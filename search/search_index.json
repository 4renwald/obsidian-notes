This is the most common type of NDA that protects the work of penetration testers. <code>Multilateral NDA</code> Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, all parties responsible and involved must sign this document. <p>Exceptions can also be made in urgent cases, where we jump into the kick-off meeting, which can also occur via an online conference. It is essential to know\u00a0<code>who in the company is permitted</code>\u00a0to contract us for a penetration test. Because we cannot accept such an order from everyone. Imagine, for example, that a company employee hires us with the pretext of checking the corporate network's security. However, after we finished the assessment, it turned out that this employee wanted to harm their own company and had no authorization to have the company tested. This would put us in a critical situation from a legal point of view.</p> <p>Below is a sample (not exhaustive) list of company members who may be authorized to hire us for penetration testing.

Do they need a web application or mobile application assessment? Secure code review? Should the Internal Penetration Test be black box and semi-evasive? Do they want just a phishing assessment as part of the Social Engineering Assessment or also vishing calls? This is our chance to explain the depth and breadth of our services, ensure that we understand our client's needs and expectations, and ensure that we can adequately deliver the assessment they require.</p> <p>Aside from the assessment type, client name, address, and key personnel contact information, some other critical pieces of information include:</p> How many expected live hosts? How many IPs/CIDR ranges in scope? How many Domains/Subdomains are in scope? How many wireless SSIDs in scope? How many web/mobile applications? If testing is authenticated, how many roles (standard user, admin, etc.)? For a phishing assessment, how many users will be targeted? Will the client provide a list, or we will be required to gather this list via OSINT? If the client is requesting a Physical Assessment, how many locations? If multiple sites are in-scope, are they geographically dispersed? What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope? Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired? Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user? Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)? <p>Finally, we will want to ask about information disclosure and evasiveness (if applicable to the assessment type):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is the Penetration Test black box (no information provided), grey box (only IP address/CIDR ranges/URLs provided), white box (detailed information provided)</p> </li> <li> <p>Would they like us to test from a non-evasive, hybrid-evasive (start quiet and gradually become \"louder\" to assess at what level the client's security personnel detect our activities), or fully evasive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This information will help us ensure we assign the right resources and deliver the engagement based on the client's expectations.

The contractor agrees to treat all confidential information brought to its attention as strictly confidential, even after the order/project is completed. Furthermore, any exceptions to confidentiality, the transferability of rights and obligations, and contractual penalties shall be stipulated in the agreement. The NDA should be signed before the kick-off meeting or at the latest during the meeting before any information is discussed in detail. <code>\u2610 Goals</code> Goals are milestones that must be achieved during the order/project. In this process, goal setting is started with the significant goals and continued with fine-grained and small ones. <code>\u2610 Scope</code> The individual components to be tested are discussed and defined. These may include domains, IP ranges, individual hosts, specific accounts, security systems, etc. Our customers may expect us to find out one or the other point by ourselves. However, the legal basis for testing the individual components has the highest priority here. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testing Type</code> When choosing the type of penetration test, we present the individual options and explain the advantages and disadvantages. Since we already know the goals and scope of our customers, we can and should also make a recommendation on what we advise and justify our recommendation accordingly. Which type is used in the end is the client's decision. <code>\u2610 Methodologies</code> Examples: OSSTMM, OWASP, automated and manual unauthenticated analysis of the internal and external network components, vulnerability assessments of network components and web applications, vulnerability threat vectorization, verification and exploitation, and exploit development to facilitate evasion techniques. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testing Locations</code> External: Remote (via secure VPN) and/or Internal: Internal or Remote (via secure VPN) <code>\u2610 Time Estimation</code> For the time estimation, we need the start and the end date for the penetration test. This gives us a precise time window to perform the test and helps us plan our procedure. It is also vital to explicitly ask how time windows the individual attacks (Exploitation / Post-Exploitation / Lateral Movement) are to be carried out. These can be carried out during or outside regular working hours. When testing outside regular working hours, the focus is more on the security solutions and systems that should withstand our attacks. <code>\u2610 Third Parties</code> For the third parties, it must be determined via which third-party providers our customer obtains services. These can be cloud providers, ISPs, and other hosting providers. Our client must obtain written consent from these providers describing that they agree and are aware that certain parts of their service will be subject to a simulated hacking attack. It is also highly advisable to require the contractor to forward the third-party permission sent to us so that we have actual confirmation that this permission has indeed been obtained. <code>\u2610 Evasive Testing</code> Evasive testing is the test of evading and passing security traffic and security systems in the customer's infrastructure. We look for techniques that allow us to find out information about the internal components and attack them. It depends on whether our contractor wants us to use such techniques or not. <code>\u2610 Risks</code> We must also inform our client about the risks involved in the tests and the possible consequences. Based on the risks and their potential severity, we can then set the limitations together and take certain precautions. <code>\u2610 Scope Limitations &amp; Restrictions</code> It is also essential to determine which servers, workstations, or other network components are essential for the client's proper functioning and its customers. We will have to avoid these and must not influence them any further, as this could lead to critical technical errors that could also affect our client's customers in production. <code>\u2610 Information Handling</code> HIPAA, PCI, HITRUST, FISMA/NIST, etc. <code>\u2610 Contact Information</code> For the contact information, we need to create a list of each person's name, title, job title, e-mail address, phone number, office phone number, and an escalation priority order. <code>\u2610 Lines of Communication</code> It should also be documented which communication channels are used to exchange information between the customer and us. This may involve e-mail correspondence, telephone calls, or personal meetings. <code>\u2610 Reporting</code> Apart from the report's structure, any customer-specific requirements the report should contain are also discussed. In addition, we clarify how the reporting is to take place and whether a presentation of the results is desired. <code>\u2610 Payment Terms</code> Finally, prices and the terms of payment are explained. <p>The most crucial element of this meeting is the detailed presentation of the penetration test to our client and its focus. As we already know, each piece of infrastructure is unique for the most part, and each client has particular preferences on which they place the most importance. Finding out these priorities is an essential part of this meeting.</p> <p>We can think of it as ordering in a restaurant. If we want a medium-rare steak and the chef gives us a well-done steak because he believes it is better, it will not be what we were hoping for. Therefore, we should prioritize our client's wishes and serve the steak as they ordered.</p> <p>Based on the\u00a0<code>Contract Checklist</code>\u00a0and the input information shared in scoping, the\u00a0<code>Penetration Testing Proposal</code>\u00a0(<code>Contract</code>) and the associated\u00a0<code>Rules of Engagement</code>\u00a0(<code>RoE</code>) are created.</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Process","Pre-Engagement"]},{"location":"Pentesting/0.%20Penetration%20Testing%20Process/Assessment%20Specific%20Stages/0.%20Pre-Engagement/#rules-of-engagement-checklist","title":"Rules of Engagement - Checklist","text":"Checkpoint Contents <code>\u2610 Introduction</code> Description of this document. <code>\u2610 Contractor</code> Company name, contractor full name, job title. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testers</code> Company name, pentesters full name. <code>\u2610 Contact Information</code> Mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of all client parties and penetration testers. <code>\u2610 Purpose</code> Description of the purpose for the conducted penetration test. <code>\u2610 Goals</code> Description of the goals that should be achieved with the penetration test. <code>\u2610 Scope</code> All IPs, domain names, URLs, or CIDR ranges. <code>\u2610 Lines of Communication</code> Online conferences or phone calls or face-to-face meetings, or via e-mail. <code>\u2610 Time Estimation</code> Start and end dates. <code>\u2610 Time of the Day to Test</code> Times of the day to test. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testing Type</code> External/Internal Penetration Test/Vulnerability Assessments/Social Engineering. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testing Locations</code> Description of how the connection to the client network is established. <code>\u2610 Methodologies</code> OSSTMM, PTES, OWASP, and others. <code>\u2610 Objectives / Flags</code> Users, specific files, specific information, and others. <code>\u2610 Evidence Handling</code> Encryption, secure protocols <code>\u2610 System Backups</code> Configuration files, databases, and others. <code>\u2610 Information Handling</code> Strong data encryption <code>\u2610 Incident Handling and Reporting</code> Cases for contact, pentest interruptions, type of reports <code>\u2610 Status Meetings</code> Frequency of meetings, dates, times, included parties <code>\u2610 Reporting</code> Type, target readers, focus <code>\u2610 Retesting</code> Start and end dates <code>\u2610 Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</code> System damage, data loss <code>\u2610 Permission to Test</code> Signed contract, contractors agreement","tags":["Pentesting","Process","Pre-Engagement"]},{"location":"Pentesting/0.%20Penetration%20Testing%20Process/Assessment%20Specific%20Stages/0.%20Pre-Engagement/#kick-off-meeting","title":"Kick-Off Meeting","text":"<p>The\u00a0<code>kick-off meeting</code>\u00a0usually occurs at a scheduled time and in-person after signing all contractual documents.

We will go over the nature of the penetration test and how it will take place. Usually, there is no Denial of Service (DoS) testing. We also explain that if a critical vulnerability is identified, penetration testing activities will be paused, a vulnerability notification report will be generated, and the emergency contacts will be contacted. Typically these are only generated during External Penetration Tests for critical flaws such as unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection, or another flaw that leads to sensitive data disclosure. The purpose of this notification is to allow the client to assess the risk internally and determine if the issue warrants an emergency fix. We would typically only stop an Internal Penetration Test and alert the client if a system becomes unresponsive, we find evidence of illegal activity (such as illegal content on a file share) or the presence of an external threat actor in the network or a prior breach.</p> <p>We must also inform our customers about potential risks during a penetration test.

The vulnerability assessment phase is an analytical process based on the findings.</p> <p></p> <p><code>An analysis is a detailed examination of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that with the help of certain precautions and actions, can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences.</code></p> <p>Any analysis can be very complicated, as many different factors and their interdependencies play a significant role. Apart from the fact that we work with the three different times (past, present, and future) during each analysis, the origin and destination play a significant role. There are four different types of analysis:</p> Analysis Type Description <code>Descriptive</code> Descriptive analysis is essential in any data analysis. On the one hand, it describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection or outliers in the data set. <code>Diagnostic</code> Diagnostic analysis clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. We must take a backward-looking view, similar to descriptive analysis, with the subtle difference that we try to find reasons for events and developments. <code>Predictive</code> By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible. <code>Prescriptive</code> Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or process. <p>We use our results and information obtained so far and analyze them to make conclusions. The formation of conclusions can be extended very far, but we must then confirm or disprove them. Suppose we found an open TCP port 2121 on a host during the information-gathering phase.</p> <p>Other than the fact that this port is open, Nmap did not show us anything else. We must now ask ourselves what conclusions can be drawn from this result. Therefore, it does not matter which question we start with to make our conclusions.

One of the most common examples is\u00a0ransomware. If a system in the corporate network is infected with ransomware, it can spread across the entire network. It locks down all the systems using various encryption methods, making them unusable for the whole company until a decryption key is entered.</p> <p>In the most common cases, the company is financially extorted to make a profit. Often, it is only at this moment that companies realize how important IT security is. If they had had a good penetration tester who had tested things (and proper processes and layered defenses in place), they probably could have prevented such a situation and the financial (if not legal) damage. It is often forgotten that in many countries, the\u00a0<code>CEOs are held liable</code>\u00a0for not securing their customer data appropriately.</p> <p></p> <p>In this stage, we want to test how far we can move manually in the entire network and what vulnerabilities we can find from the internal perspective that might be exploited. In doing so, we will again run through several phases:</p> <ol> <li>Pivoting</li> <li>Evasive Testing</li> <li>Information Gathering</li> <li>Vulnerability Assessment</li> <li>(Privilege) Exploitation</li> <li>Post-Exploitation</li> </ol> <p>As seen in the graphic above, we can move to this stage from the\u00a0<code>Exploitation</code>\u00a0and the\u00a0<code>Post-Exploitation</code>\u00a0stage.

In project management, it serves as proof that a project is feasible in principle. The criteria for this can lie in technical or business factors. Therefore, it is the basis for further work, in our case, the necessary steps to secure the corporate network by confirming the discovered vulnerabilities. In other words, it serves as a decision-making basis for the further course of action. At the same time, it enables risks to be identified and minimized.</p> <p></p> <p>This project step is often integrated into the development process for new application software (prototyping) or IT security solutions. For us in information security, this is where we prove vulnerabilities in operating systems or application software. We use this PoC to prove that a security problem exists so that the developers or administrators can validate it, reproduce it, see the impact, and test their remediation efforts. One of the most common examples used to prove software vulnerabilities is executing the calculator (calc.exe on Windows) on the target system. In principle, the PoC also assesses the probability of success of system access from actual exploitation.</p> <p>A\u00a0<code>PoC</code>\u00a0can have many different representations. For example,\u00a0<code>documentation</code>\u00a0of the vulnerabilities found can also constitute a PoC. The more practical version of a PoC is a\u00a0<code>script</code>\u00a0or\u00a0<code>code</code>\u00a0that automatically exploits the vulnerabilities found. This demonstrates the flawless exploitation of the vulnerabilities. This variant is straightforward for an administrator or developer because they can see what steps our script takes to exploit the vulnerability.</p> <p>However, there is one significant disadvantage that has occurred from time to time. Once the administrators and developers have received such a script from us, it is easy for them to \"fight\" against our script. They focus on changing the systems so that the script we created no longer works. The important thing is that the script is only\u00a0<code>one way</code>\u00a0of exploiting a given vulnerability. Therefore, working against our script instead of with it and modifying and securing the systems so that our script no longer works does not mean that the information obtained from the script cannot be obtained in another way. It is an important aspect that should be discussed with the administrators and developers and explicitly mentioned and pointed out.</p> <p>The report they receive from us should help them see the entire picture, focus on the broader issues, and provide clear remediation advice. Including an attack chain walkthrough in the event of domain compromise during an internal is a great way to show how multiple flaws can be combined and how fixing one flaw will break the chain, but the other flaws will still exist. If these are not also fixed, there may be another path to get to the point where the attack chain was remediated and continue onwards. We should also drive this point home during our report review meeting.</p> <p>For example, if a user uses the password\u00a0<code>Password123</code>, the underlying vulnerability is not the password but the\u00a0<code>password policy</code>.

This procedure is abbreviated <code>Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone</code> (<code>AXFR</code>). Since a DNS failure usually has severe consequences for a company, the zone file is almost invariably kept identical on several name servers. When changes are made, it must be ensured that all servers have the same data. Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer. Using a secret key <code>rndc-key</code>, which we have seen initially in the default configuration, the servers make sure that they communicate with their own master or slave. Zone transfer involves the mere transfer of files or records and the detection of discrepancies in the data sets of the servers involved.</p> <p>The original data of a zone is located on a DNS server, which is called the <code>primary</code> name server for this zone. However, to increase the reliability, realize a simple load distribution, or protect the primary from attacks, one or more additional servers are installed in practice in almost all cases, which are called <code>secondary</code> name servers for this zone. For some <code>Top-Level Domains</code> (<code>TLDs</code>), making zone files for the <code>Second Level Domains</code> accessible on at least two servers is mandatory.</p> <p>DNS entries are generally only created, modified, or deleted on the primary. This can be done by manually editing the relevant zone file or automatically by a dynamic update from a database. A DNS server that serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file is called a master. A DNS server that obtains zone data from a master is called a slave. A primary is always a master, while a secondary can be both a slave and a master.</p> <p>The slave fetches the <code>SOA</code> record of the relevant zone from the master at certain intervals, the so-called refresh time, usually one hour, and compares the serial numbers. If the serial number of the SOA record of the master is greater than that of the slave, the data sets no longer match.</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","DNS"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/DNS%20%2853%29/Footprinting%20the%20Service/#dig-axfr-zone-transfer","title":"DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer","text":"<pre><code>arenwald@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128\n\n; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.16.1-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128\n;; global options: +cmd\ninlanefreight.htb.      604800  IN      SOA     inlanefreight.htb. root.inlanefreight.htb. 2 604800 86400 2419200 604800\ninlanefreight.htb.      604800  IN      TXT     \"MS=ms97310371\"\ninlanefreight.htb.      604800  IN      TXT     \"atlassian-domain-verification=t1rKCy68JFszSdCKVpw64A1QksWdXuYFUeSXKU\"\ninlanefreight.htb.      604800  IN      TXT     \"v=spf1 include:mailgun.org include:_spf.google.com include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:_spf.atlassian.net ip4:10.129.124.8 ip4:10.129.127.2 ip4:10.129.42.106 ~all\"\ninlanefreight.htb.      604800  IN      NS      ns.inlanefreight.htb.\napp.inlanefreight.htb.  604800  IN      A       10.129.18.15\ninternal.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN   A       10.129.1.6\nmail1.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN      A       10.129.18.201\nns.inlanefreight.htb.   604800  IN      A       10.129.34.136\ninlanefreight.htb.      604800  IN      SOA     inlanefreight.htb. root.inlanefreight.htb. 2 604800 86400 2419200 604800\n;; Query time: 4 msec\n;; SERVER: 10.129.14.128#53(10.129.14.128)\n;; WHEN: So Sep 19 18:51:19 CEST 2021\n;; XFR size: 9 records (messages 1, bytes 520)\n</code></pre> <p>If the administrator used a subnet for the <code>allow-transfer</code> option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to <code>any</code>, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server.

As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (<code>ICANN</code>) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are <code>13</code> such root servers around the globe. <code>Authoritative Nameserver</code> Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone.

If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. <code>Non-authoritative Nameserver</code> Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying. <code>Caching DNS Server</code> Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage. <code>Forwarding Server</code> Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server. <code>Resolver</code> Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.","tags":["Information_Gathering","Pentesting","DNS"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/DNS%20%2853%29/Subdomain%20Bruteforcing/","title":"Subdomain Bruteforcing","text":"<p>There are several tools available that excel at brute-force enumeration:</p> Tool Description dnsenum Comprehensive DNS enumeration tool that supports dictionary and brute-force attacks for discovering subdomains. fierce User-friendly tool for recursive subdomain discovery, featuring wildcard detection and an easy-to-use interface. dnsrecon Versatile tool that combines multiple DNS reconnaissance techniques and offers customisable output formats. amass Actively maintained tool focused on subdomain discovery, known for its integration with other tools and extensive data sources. assetfinder Simple yet effective tool for finding subdomains using various techniques, ideal for quick and lightweight scans. puredns Powerful and flexible DNS brute-forcing tool, capable of resolving and filtering results effectively. <pre><code>arenwald@htb[/htb]$ for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done\n\nns.inlanefreight.htb.   604800  IN      A       10.129.34.136\nmail1.inlanefreight.htb. 604800 IN      A       10.129.18.201\napp.inlanefreight.htb.  604800  IN      A       10.129.18.15\n</code></pre> <p>Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way.

This is often used to allow everyone on the internal network to share files and data without accessing each other's computers.

During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using <code>Hashcat</code> mode <code>7300</code>. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command <code>hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u</code> which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.</p> <p>There is no direct \"fix\" to this issue because the flaw is a critical component of the IPMI specification.

Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard. BMCs are built into many motherboards but can also be added to a system as a PCI card. Most servers either come with a BMC or support adding a BMC. The most common BMCs we often see during internal penetration tests are HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI. If we can access a BMC during an assessment, we would gain full access to the host motherboard and be able to monitor, reboot, power off, or even reinstall the host operating system. Gaining access to a BMC is nearly equivalent to physical access to a system. Many BMCs (including HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI) expose a web-based management console, some sort of command-line remote access protocol such as Telnet or SSH, and the port 623 UDP, which, again, is for the IPMI network protocol.

It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system. IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state. It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. IPMI can also be used for remote upgrades to systems without requiring physical access to the target host. IPMI is typically used in three ways:</p> <ul> <li>Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings</li> <li>When the host is fully powered down</li> <li>Access to a host after a system failure</li> </ul> <p>When not being used for these tasks, IPMI can monitor a range of different things such as system temperature, voltage, fan status, and power supplies. It can also be used for querying inventory information, reviewing hardware logs, and alerting using SNMP. The host system can be powered off, but the IPMI module requires a power source and a LAN connection to work correctly.</p> <p>The IPMI protocol was first published by Intel in 1998 and is now supported by over 200 system vendors, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Supermicro, Intel, and more. Systems using IPMI version 2.0 can be administered via serial over LAN, giving sysadmins the ability to view serial console output in band. To function, IPMI requires the following components:</p> <ul> <li>Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI</li> <li>Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB) - An interface that permits communication from one chassis to another</li> <li>Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) - extends the BMC</li> <li>IPMI Memory - stores things such as the system event log, repository store data, and more</li> <li>Communications Interfaces - local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB and PCI Management Bus</li> </ul>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","IPMI"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/MSSQL%20%281433%2C1434%2C2433%29/Clients/","title":"Clients","text":"","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","MSSQL"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/MSSQL%20%281433%2C1434%2C2433%29/Clients/#mssql-clients","title":"MSSQL Clients","text":"<p>SQL Server Management Studio (<code>SSMS</code>) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded &amp; installed separately.

MySQL works according to the <code>client-server principle</code> and consists of a MySQL server and one or more MySQL clients. The MySQL server is the actual database management system. It takes care of data storage and distribution. The data is stored in tables with different columns, rows, and data types.

However, some common settings are usually configured by default in Oracle TNS. By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the <code>TCP/1521</code> port. However, this default port can be changed during installation or later in the configuration file. The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including <code>TCP/IP</code>, <code>UDP</code>, <code>IPX/SPX</code>, and <code>AppleTalk</code>. The listener can also support multiple network interfaces and listen on specific IP addresses or all available network interfaces. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in <code>Oracle 8i</code>/<code>9i</code> but not in Oracle 10g/11g.</p> <p>The default configuration of the TNS listener also includes a few basic security features. For example, the listener will only accept connections from authorized hosts and perform basic authentication using a combination of hostnames, IP addresses, and usernames and passwords. Additionally, the listener will use Oracle Net Services to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. The configuration files for Oracle TNS are called <code>tnsnames.ora</code> and <code>listener.ora</code> and are typically located in the <code>$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin</code> directory. The plain text file contains configuration information for Oracle database instances and other network services that use the TNS protocol.</p> <p>Oracle TNS is often used with other Oracle services like Oracle DBSNMP, Oracle Databases, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, web servers, and many more. There have been made many changes for the default installation of Oracle services. For example, Oracle 9 has a default password, <code>CHANGE_ON_INSTALL</code>, whereas Oracle 10 has no default password set. The Oracle DBSNMP service also uses a default password, <code>dbsnmp</code> that we should remember when we come across this one. Another example would be that many organizations still use the <code>finger</code> service together with Oracle, which can put Oracle's service at risk and make it vulnerable when we have the required knowledge of a home directory.</p> <p>Each database or service has a unique entry in the tnsnames.ora file, containing the necessary information for clients to connect to the service. The entry consists of a name for the service, the network location of the service, and the database or service name that clients should use when connecting to the service. For example, a simple <code>tnsnames.ora</code> file might look like this:</p>","tags":["Information_Gathering","Pentesting","Oracle_TNS"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/Oracle%20TNS%20%281521%29/Default%20Configuration/#tnsnamesora","title":"Tnsnames.ora","text":"<pre><code>ORCL =\n  (DESCRIPTION =\n    (ADDRESS_LIST =\n      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))\n    )\n    (CONNECT_DATA =\n      (SERVER = DEDICATED)\n      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)\n    )\n  )\n</code></pre> <p>Here we can see a service called <code>ORCL</code>, which is listening on port <code>TCP/1521</code> on the IP address <code>10.129.11.102</code>.

In Oracle RDBMS, a System Identifier (<code>SID</code>) is a unique name that identifies a particular database instance. It can have multiple instances, each with its own System ID. An instance is a set of processes and memory structures that interact to manage the database's data. When a client connects to an Oracle database, it specifies the database's <code>SID</code> along with its connection string. The client uses this SID to identify which database instance it wants to connect to. Suppose the client does not specify a SID. Then, the default value defined in the <code>tnsnames.ora</code> file is used.</p> <p>The SIDs are an essential part of the connection process, as it identifies the specific instance of the database the client wants to connect to. If the client specifies an incorrect SID, the connection attempt will fail. Database administrators can use the SID to monitor and manage the individual instances of a database. For example, they can start, stop, or restart an instance, adjust its memory allocation or other configuration parameters, and monitor its performance using tools like Oracle Enterprise Manager.</p> <p>There are various ways to enumerate, or better said, guess SIDs.

Initially developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (<code>CSRG</code>) at the University of California, Berkeley, <code>r-services</code> were the de facto standard for remote access between Unix operating systems until they were replaced by the Secure Shell (<code>SSH</code>) protocols and commands due to inherent security flaws built into them. Much like <code>telnet</code>, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (<code>MITM</code>) attacks.</p> <p><code>R-services</code> span across the ports <code>512</code>, <code>513</code>, and <code>514</code> and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as <code>r-commands</code>.

While less common nowadays, we do run into them from time to time during our internal penetration tests so it is worth understanding how to approach them.</p> <p>The R-commands suite consists of the following programs:</p> <ul> <li>rcp (<code>remote copy</code>)</li> <li>rexec (<code>remote execution</code>)</li> <li>rlogin (<code>remote login</code>)</li> <li>rsh (<code>remote shell</code>)</li> <li>rstat</li> <li>ruptime</li> <li>rwho (<code>remote who</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Each command has its intended functionality; however, we will only cover the most commonly abused <code>r-commands</code>.

Requires authentication through the use of a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the <code>/etc/hosts.equiv</code> and <code>.rhosts</code> files. <code>rlogin</code> <code>rlogind</code> 513 TCP Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to <code>telnet</code> but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the <code>/etc/hosts.equiv</code> and <code>.rhosts</code> files. <p>The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network.

This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port 3389 as the transport protocol. However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration.</p> <p>For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside. If Network Address Translation (<code>NAT</code>) is used on the route between client and server, as is often the case with Internet connections, the remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server.</p> <p>RDP has handled Transport Layer Security (<code>TLS/SSL</code>) since Windows Vista, which means that all data, and especially the login process, is protected in the network by its good encryption. However, many Windows systems do not insist on this but still accept inadequate encryption via RDP Security. Nevertheless, even with this, an attacker is still far from being locked out because the identity-providing certificates are merely self-signed by default. This means that the client cannot distinguish a genuine certificate from a forged one and generates a certificate warning for the user.</p> <p>The <code>Remote Desktop</code> service is installed by default on Windows servers and does not require additional external applications. This service can be activated using the <code>Server Manager</code> and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with Network level authentication (<code>NLA</code>).</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","RDP"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/RSYNC%20%28873%29/Footprinting%20the%20Service/","title":"Footprinting the Service","text":"","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","RSYNC"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/RSYNC%20%28873%29/Footprinting%20the%20Service/#scanning-for-rsync","title":"Scanning for Rsync","text":"<pre><code>arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1\n\nStarting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-19 09:31 EDT\nNmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)\nHost is up (0.0058s latency).\n\nPORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION\n873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)\n\nService detection performed.

This guide is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","RSYNC"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/RSYNC%20%28873%29/Overview/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Rsync is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses port <code>873</code> and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.</p> <p>This guide covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials. If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.</p> <p>Let's do a bit of quick footprinting.

However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the setting <code>browseable = yes</code> as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.</p> Setting Description <code>browseable = yes</code> Allow listing available shares in the current share? <code>read only = no</code> Forbid the creation and modification of files? <code>writable = yes</code> Allow users to create and modify files? <code>guest ok = yes</code> Allow connecting to the service without using a password? <code>enable privileges = yes</code> Honor privileges assigned to specific SID? <code>create mask = 0777</code> What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files? <code>directory mask = 0777</code> What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? <code>logon script = script.sh</code> What script needs to be executed on the user's login? <code>magic script = script.sh</code> Which script should be executed when the script gets closed? <code>magic output = script.out</code> Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored? Let us create a share called <code>[notes]</code> and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share. For example, this setting is often applied, if only for testing purposes. If it is then an internal subnet of a small team in a large department, this setting is often retained or forgotten to be reset.

For this purpose, most modern SMTP servers support the protocol extension ESMTP with SMTP-Auth. After sending his e-mail, the SMTP client, also known as <code>Mail User Agent</code> (<code>MUA</code>), converts it into a header and a body and uploads both to the SMTP server. This has a so-called <code>Mail Transfer Agent</code> (<code>MTA</code>), the software basis for sending and receiving e-mails. The MTA checks the e-mail for size and spam and then stores it. To relieve the MTA, it is occasionally preceded by a <code>Mail Submission Agent</code> (<code>MSA</code>), which checks the validity, i.e., the origin of the e-mail. This <code>MSA</code> is also called <code>Relay</code> server. These are very important later on, as the so-called <code>Open Relay Attack</code> can be carried out on many SMTP servers due to incorrect configuration. We will discuss this attack and how to identify the weak point for it a little later. The MTA then searches the DNS for the IP address of the recipient mail server.</p> <p>On arrival at the destination SMTP server, the data packets are reassembled to form a complete e-mail. From there, the <code>Mail delivery agent</code> (<code>MDA</code>) transfers it to the recipient's mailbox.</p> Client (<code>MUA</code>) <code>\u279e</code> Submission Agent (<code>MSA</code>) <code>\u279e</code> Open Relay (<code>MTA</code>) <code>\u279e</code> Mail Delivery Agent (<code>MDA</code>) <code>\u279e</code> Mailbox (<code>POP3</code>/<code>IMAP</code>) <p>But SMTP has two disadvantages inherent to the network protocol.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The first is that sending an email using SMTP does not return a usable delivery confirmation. Although the specifications of the protocol provide for this type of notification, its formatting is not specified by default, so that usually only an English-language error message, including the header of the undelivered message, is returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>Users are not authenticated when a connection is established, and the sender of an email is therefore unreliable. As a result, open SMTP relays are often misused to send spam en masse. The originators use arbitrary fake sender addresses for this purpose to not be traced (mail spoofing). Today, many different security techniques are used to prevent the misuse of SMTP servers. For example, suspicious emails are rejected or moved to quarantine (spam folder). For example, responsible for this are the identification protocol DomainKeys (<code>DKIM</code>), the Sender Policy Framework (<code>SPF</code>).</p> </li> </ol> <p>For this purpose, an extension for SMTP has been developed called <code>Extended SMTP</code> (<code>ESMTP</code>). When people talk about SMTP in general, they usually mean ESMTP. ESMTP uses TLS, which is done after the <code>EHLO</code> command by sending <code>STARTTLS</code>. This initializes the SSL-protected SMTP connection, and from this moment on, the entire connection is encrypted, and therefore more or less secure. Now AUTH PLAIN extension for authentication can also be used safely.</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","SMTP"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/SNMP%20%28161%2C162%2C10161%2C10162%29/Dangerous%20Settings/","title":"Dangerous Settings","text":"<p>Some dangerous settings that the administrator can make with SNMP are:</p> Settings Description <code>rwuser noauth</code> Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication. <code>rwcommunity &lt;community string&gt; &lt;IPv4 address&gt;</code> Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from. <code>rwcommunity6 &lt;community string&gt; &lt;IPv6 address&gt;</code> Same access as with <code>rwcommunity</code> with the difference of using IPv6.","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","SNMP"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/SNMP%20%28161%2C162%2C10161%2C10162%29/Default%20Configuration/","title":"Default Configuration","text":"<p>The default configuration of the SNMP daemon defines the basic settings for the service, which include the IP addresses, ports, MIB, OIDs, authentication, and community strings.</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","SNMP"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Services/SNMP%20%28161%2C162%2C10161%2C10162%29/Default%20Configuration/#snmp-daemon-config","title":"SNMP Daemon Config","text":"<pre><code>arenwald@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v \"#\" | sed -r '/^\\s*$/d'\n\nsysLocation    Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\nsysContact     Me &lt;me@example.org&gt;\nsysServices    72\nmaster  agentx\nagentaddress  127.0.0.1,[::1]\nview   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1\nview   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1\nrocommunity  public default -V systemonly\nrocommunity6 public default -V systemonly\nrouser authPrivUser authpriv -V systemonly\n</code></pre> <p>The configuration of this service can also be changed in many ways.

WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (<code>SOAP</code>) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10. WinRM relies on <code>TCP</code> ports <code>5985</code> and <code>5986</code> for communication, with the last port <code>5986 using HTTPS</code>, as ports 80 and 443 were previously used for this task. However, since port 80 was mainly blocked for security reasons, the newer ports 5985 and 5986 are used today.</p> <p>Another component that fits WinRM for administration is Windows Remote Shell (<code>WinRS</code>), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. The program is even included on Windows 7 by default. Thus, with WinRM, it is possible to execute a remote command on another server.</p> <p>Services like remote sessions using PowerShell and event log merging require WinRM. It is enabled by default starting with the <code>Windows Server 2012</code> version, but it must first be configured for older server versions and clients, and the necessary firewall exceptions created.</p>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","WinRM"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Network%20Enumeration/Tools/Nmap/Firewall%2C%20IDS%20and%20IPS%20Evasion/","title":"Firewall, IDS and IPS Evasion","text":"SWITCH *EXAMPLE* *DESCRIPTION* -f nmap 192.168.1.1 -f Requested scan (including ping scans) use tiny fragmented IP packets.

Once verified, the CA issues a <code>pre-certificate</code>, a preliminary certificate version.</li> <li><code>Log Submission</code>: The CA then submits this <code>pre-certificate</code> to multiple CT logs. Each log is operated by a different organisation, ensuring redundancy and decentralisation. The logs are essentially <code>append-only</code>, meaning that once a certificate is added, it cannot be modified or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the historical record.</li> <li><code>Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)</code>: Upon receiving the <code>pre-certificate</code>, each CT log generates a <code>Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)</code>. This <code>SCT</code> is a cryptographic proof that the certificate was submitted to the log at a specific time. The <code>SCT</code> is then included in the final certificate issued to the website owner.</li> <li><code>Browser Verification</code>: When a user's browser connects to a website, it checks the certificate's <code>SCTs</code>. These <code>SCTs</code> are verified against the public CT logs to confirm that the certificate was issued and logged correctly. If the <code>SCTs</code> are valid, the browser establishes a secure connection; if not, it may display a warning to the user.</li> <li><code>Monitoring and Auditing</code>: CT logs are continuously monitored by various entities, including security researchers, website owners, and <code>browser vendors</code>. These monitors look for anomalies or suspicious certificates, such as those issued for domains they don't own or certificates violating industry standards. If any issues are found, they can be reported to the relevant <code>CA</code> for investigation and potential revocation of the certificate.</li> </ol>","tags":["Pentesting","Information_Gathering","Web_Enumeration"]},{"location":"Pentesting/1.%20Information%20Gathering/Web%20Enumeration/Passive/Certificate%20Transparency%20%28CT%29%20Logs/#the-merkle-tree-structure","title":"The Merkle Tree Structure","text":"<p>To ensure CT logs' integrity and tamper-proof nature, they employ a Merkle tree cryptographic structure. This structure organises the certificates in a tree-like fashion, where each leaf node represents a certificate, and each non-leaf node represents a hash of its child nodes. The root of the tree, known as the Merkle root, is a single hash representing the entire log.</p> <p>Let's visualise this with a hypothetical Merkle tree for <code>inlanefreight.com</code>:</p> <p></p> <p>In this hypothetical tree:</p> <ul> <li><code>Root Hash</code>: The topmost node, a single hash representing the entire log's state.</li> <li><code>Hash 1 &amp; Hash 2</code>: Intermediate nodes, each a hash of two child nodes (either certificates or other hashes).</li> <li><code>Cert 1 - Cert 4</code>: Leaf nodes representing individual SSL/TLS certificates for different subdomains of <code>inlanefreight.com</code>.</li> </ul> <p>This structure allows for efficient verification of any certificate in the log. By providing the Merkle path (a series of hashes) for a particular certificate, anyone can verify that it is included in the log without downloading the entire log. For instance, to verify <code>Cert 2 (blog.inlanefreight.com)</code>, you would need:</p> <ol> <li><code>Cert 2's hash</code>: This directly verifies the certificate itself.</li> <li><code>Hash 1</code>: Verifies that Cert 2's hash is correctly paired with Cert 1's hash.</li> <li><code>Root Hash</code>: Confirms that Hash 1 is a valid part of the overall log structure.</li> </ol> <p>This process ensures that even if a single bit of data in a certificate or the log itself is altered, the root hash will change, immediately signaling tampering.

However, although the process of whitelisting all command lines in a particular environment is initially time-consuming, it is very robust and allows for quick detection and alerting on any unusual command lines.</p> <p>Most client-server protocols require the client and server to negotiate how content will be delivered before exchanging information. This is common with the\u00a0<code>HTTP</code>\u00a0protocol. There is a need for interoperability amongst different web servers and web browser types to ensure that users have the same experience no matter their browser. HTTP clients are most readily recognized by their user agent string, which the server uses to identify which\u00a0<code>HTTP</code>\u00a0client is connecting to it, for example, Firefox, Chrome, etc.</p> <p>User agents are not only used to identify web browsers, but anything acting as an\u00a0<code>HTTP</code>\u00a0client and connecting to a web server via\u00a0<code>HTTP</code>\u00a0can have a user agent string (i.e.,\u00a0<code>cURL</code>, a custom\u00a0<code>Python</code>\u00a0script, or common tools such as\u00a0<code>sqlmap</code>, or\u00a0<code>Nmap</code>).</p> <p>Organizations can take some steps to identify potential user agent strings by first building a list of known legitimate user agent strings, user agents used by default operating system processes, common user agents used by update services such as Windows Update, and antivirus updates, etc. These can be fed into a SIEM tool used for threat hunting to filter out legitimate traffic and focus on anomalies that may indicate suspicious behavior. Any suspicious-looking user agent strings can then be further investigated to determine whether they were used to perform malicious actions. This\u00a0website\u00a0is handy for identifying common user agent strings. A list of user agent strings is available\u00a0here.</p> <p>Malicious file transfers can also be detected by their user agents.

We will cover each of them in more depth in the coming sections, and we'll learn how to use various instructions.</p> <p>There are two main Instruction Set Architectures that are widely used:</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>Complex Instruction Set Computer</code> (<code>CISC</code>) - Used in <code>Intel</code> and <code>AMD</code> processors in most computers and servers.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Reduced Instruction Set Computer</code> (<code>RISC</code>) - Used in <code>ARM</code> and <code>Apple</code> processors, in most smartphones, and some modern laptops.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Let us see the pros and cons of each and the main differences between them.</p>"},{"location":"Programming/Assembly/Infrastructure%20Set%20Architectures/#cisc","title":"CISC","text":"<p>The CISC architecture was one of the earliest ISA's ever developed. As its name suggests, the CISC architecture favors more complex instructions to be run at a time to reduce the overall number of instructions. This is done to rely as much as possible on the CPU by combining minor instructions into more complex instructions.</p> <p>For example, suppose we were to add two registers with the '<code>add rax, rbx</code>' instruction. In that case, a CISC processor can do this in a single 'Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store' instruction cycle, without having to split it into multiple instructions to fetch <code>rax</code>, then fetch <code>rbx</code>, then add them, and then store them in `rax, each of which would take its own 'Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store' instruction cycle.</p> <p>Two main reasons drove this:</p> <ol> <li>To enable more instructions to be executed at once by designing the processor to run more advanced instructions in its core.</li> <li>In the past, memory and transistors were limited, so it was preferred to write shorter programs by combining multiple instructions into one.</li> </ol> <p>To enable the processors to execute complex instructions, the processor's design becomes more complicated, as it is designed to execute a vast amount of different complex instructions, each of which has its own unit to execute it.</p> <p>Furthermore, even though it takes a single instruction cycle to execute a single instruction, as the instructions are more complex, each instruction cycle takes more clock cycles. This fact leads to more power consumption and heat to execute each instruction.</p>"},{"location":"Programming/Assembly/Infrastructure%20Set%20Architectures/#risc","title":"RISC","text":"<p>The RISC architecture favors splitting instructions into minor instructions, and so the CPU is designed only to handle simple instructions. This is done to relay the optimization to the software by writing the most optimized assembly code.</p> <p>For example, the same previous <code>add r1, r2, r3</code> instruction on a RISC processor would fetch <code>r2</code>, then fetch <code>r3</code>, add them, and finally store them in <code>r1</code>. Every instruction of these takes an entire 'Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store' instruction cycle, which leads, as can be expected, to a larger number of total instructions per program, and hence a longer assembly code.</p> <p>By not supporting various types of complex instructions, RISC processors only support a limited number of instructions (<code>~200</code>) compared to CISC processors (<code>~1500</code>). So, to execute complex instructions, this has to be done through a combination of minor instructions through Assembly.</p> <p>It is said that we can build a general-purpose computer with a processor that only supports one instruction! This indicates that we can create very complex instructions using the <code>sub</code> instruction only. Can you think of how this may be achieved?</p> <p>On the other hand, an advantage of splitting complex instructions into minor ones is having all instructions of the same length either 32-bit or 64-bit long. This enables designing the CPU clock speed around the instruction length so that executing each stage in the instruction cycle would always take precisely one machine clock cycle.</p> <p>The below diagram shows how CISC instructions take a variable amount of clock cycles, while RISC instructions take a fixed amount: </p> <p>Executing each instruction stage in a single clock cycle and only executing simple instructions leads to RISC processors consuming a fraction of the power consumed by CISC processors, which makes these processors ideal for devices that run on batteries, like smartphones and laptops.</p>"},{"location":"Programming/Assembly/Infrastructure%20Set%20Architectures/#cisc-vs-risc","title":"CISC vs. RISC","text":"<p>The following table summarizes the main differences between CISC and RISC:</p> Area CISC RISC <code>Complexity</code> Favors complex instructions Favors simple instructions <code>Length of instructions</code> Longer instructions - Variable length 'multiples of 8-bits' Shorter instructions - Fixed length '32-bit/64-bit' <code>Total instructions per program</code> Fewer total instructions - Shorter code More total instructions - Longer code <code>Optimization</code> Relies on hardware optimization (in CPU) Relies on software optimization (in Assembly) <code>Instruction Execution Time</code> Variable - Multiple clock cycles Fixed - One clock cycle <code>Instructions supported by CPU</code> Many instructions (~1500) Fewer instructions (~200) <code>Power Consumption</code> High Very low <code>Examples</code> Intel, AMD ARM, Apple <p>In the past, having a longer assembly code due to a larger number of total instructions per program was a significant disadvantage for RISC processors due to the limited resources in memory and storage.

There are two types of endianness: <code>Little-Endian</code> and <code>Big-Endian</code>. With Little-Endian processors, the little-end byte of the address is filled/retrieved first <code>right-to-left</code>, while with Big-Endian processors, the big-end byte is filled/retrieved first <code>left-to-right</code>.</p> <p>For example, if we have the address <code>0x0011223344556677</code> to be stored in memory, little-endian processors would store the <code>0x00</code> byte on the right-most bytes, and then the <code>0x11</code> byte would be filled after it, so it becomes <code>0x1100</code>, and then the <code>0x22</code> byte, so it becomes <code>0x221100</code>, and so on. Once all bytes are in place, they would look like <code>0x7766554433221100</code>, which is the reverse of the original value. Of course, when retrieving the value back, the processor will also use little-endian retrieval, so the value retrieved would be the same as the original value.</p> <p>Another example that shows how this can affect the stored values is binary. For example, if we had the 2-byte integer <code>426</code>, its binary representation is <code>00000001 10101010</code>. The order in which these two bytes are stored would change its value. For example, if we stored it in reverse as <code>10101010 00000001</code>, its value becomes <code>43521</code>.</p> <p>The big-endian processors would store these bytes as <code>00000001 10101010</code> <code>left-to-right</code>, while little-endian processors store them as <code>10101010 00000001</code> <code>right-to-left</code>. When retrieving the value, the processor has to use the same endianness used when storing them, or it will get the wrong value. This indicates that the order in which the bytes are stored/retrieved makes a big difference.</p> <p>The following table demonstrates how endianness works:</p> Address 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Address Value Little Endian 77 66 55 44 33 22 11 00 0x Big Endian 00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 0x <p>Address: 0x0011223344556677</p> <p>You can click on the \"Load Address\" button to visualize how each endianness loads data/addresses into memory.</p> <p>As we can see, this means that an address written in little-endian or in big-endian would refer to different locations in the memory, as it would be read differently by each processor type.</p> <p>This module will always use little-endian byte order, as it is used with Intel/AMD x86 in most modern operating systems, so the shellcode is always represented right-to-left.</p> <p><code>The important thing we need to take from this is knowing that our bytes are stored into memory from right-to-left.</code> So, if we were to push an address or a string with Assembly, we would have to push it in reverse. For example, if we want to store the word <code>Hello</code>, we would push its bytes in reverse: <code>o</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>e</code>, and finally <code>H</code>.</p> <p>This may seem a bit counter-intuitive since most people are used to reading from left-to-right. However, this has multiple advantages when processing data, like being able to retrieve a sub-register without having to go through the entire register or being able to perform arithmetic in the correct order right-to-left.</p>"},{"location":"Programming/Assembly/Registers%2C%20Addresses%2C%20and%20Data%20Types/#data-types","title":"Data Types","text":"<p>Finally, the x86 architecture supports many types of data sizes, which can be used with various instructions.
