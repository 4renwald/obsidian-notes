RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is commonly used in Windows networks for remote access. We can transfer files using RDP by copying and pasting. We can right-click and copy a file from the Windows machine we connect to and paste it into the RDP session.

If we are connected from Linux, we can use `xfreerdp` or `rdesktop`. At the time of writing, `xfreerdp` and `rdesktop` allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.

As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server. `rdesktop` or `xfreerdp` can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session.

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop

  Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

To access the directory, we can connect to `\\tsclient\`, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.

Alternatively, from Windows, the native [mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc) remote desktop client can be used.

After selecting the drive, we can interact with it in the remote session that follows.

**Note:** This drive is not accessible to any other users logged on to the target computer, even if they manage to hijack the RDP session.
