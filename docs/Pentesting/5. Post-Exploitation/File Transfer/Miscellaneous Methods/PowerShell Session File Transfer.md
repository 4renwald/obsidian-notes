We already talk about doing file transfers with PowerShell, but there may be scenarios where HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB are unavailable. If that's the case, we can use [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2), aka WinRM, to perform file transfer operations.

[PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2) allows us to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer using PowerShell sessions. Administrators commonly use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers in a network, and we can also use it for file transfer operations. By default, enabling PowerShell remoting creates both an HTTP and an HTTPS listener. The listeners run on default ports TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, we will need administrative access, be a member of the `Remote Management Users` group, or have explicit permissions for PowerShell Remoting in the session configuration. Let's create an example and transfer a file from `DC01` to `DATABASE01` and vice versa.

We have a session as `Administrator` in `DC01`, the user has administrative rights on `DATABASE01`, and PowerShell Remoting is enabled. Let's use Test-NetConnection to confirm we can connect to WinRM.

#### From DC01 - Confirm WinRM port TCP 5985 is Open on DATABASE01.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami

htb\administrator

PS C:\htb> hostname

DC01
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName DATABASE01 -Port 5985

ComputerName     : DATABASE01
RemoteAddress    : 192.168.1.101
RemotePort       : 5985
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet0
SourceAddress    : 192.168.1.100
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

Because this session already has privileges over `DATABASE01`, we don't need to specify credentials. In the example below, a session is created to the remote computer named `DATABASE01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

#### Create a PowerShell Remoting Session to DATABASE01

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName DATABASE01
```

We can use the `Copy-Item` cmdlet to copy a file from our local machine `DC01` to the `DATABASE01` session we have `$Session` or vice versa.

#### Copy samplefile.txt from our Localhost to the DATABASE01 Session

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path C:\samplefile.txt -ToSession $Session -Destination C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
```

#### Copy DATABASE.txt from DATABASE01 Session to our Localhost

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DATABASE.txt" -Destination C:\ -FromSession $Session
```
