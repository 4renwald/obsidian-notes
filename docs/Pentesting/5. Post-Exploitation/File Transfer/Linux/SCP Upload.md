We may find some companies that allow the `SSH protocol` (TCP/22) for outbound connections, and if that's the case, we can use an SSH server with the `scp` utility to upload files. Let's attempt to upload a file to the target machine using the SSH protocol.

#### File Upload using SCP

```shell-session
arenwald@htb[/htb]$ scp /etc/passwd htb-student@10.129.86.90:/home/htb-student/

htb-student@10.129.86.90's password: 
passwd                                                                                                           100% 3414     6.7MB/s   00:00
```

**Note:** Remember that scp syntax is similar to cp or copy.
